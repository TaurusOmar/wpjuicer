This script is exclusively for Wordpress and facilitates the localization of sensitive information in framework endpoints, aiding in recognition and data extraction by providing detailed results. The main objective of this tool is to simplify and expedite the process of discovering information useful for auditing purposes. It searches for endpoints, lists users, WordPress version, and looks for compressed or hidden files.
